## ImageAcquisition

Setup image acquisition parameters for TriSpectorP

### Description

This sample includes a UI for viewing heightmaps and 2D sensor data from a
TriSpectorP device, as well as controls for configuring image acquisition
parameters.

### How to Run

This sample may currently be outdated and thus might not work properly with the newest version of SICK AppStudio.
Editing the UI might not work properly in the latest version of SICK AppStudio. Use SICK AppStudio version <= 2.4.2 to edit the UI.

Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10). Setting a breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after the 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Image acquisition parameters can be configured in the UI on the DevicePage.
You need to be connected to a TriSpectorP, this App does not work with the
emulator.
